Mapping the Flavor:
Visualizing store and dining locations with heatmaps

----Description----
When moving, one of the biggest challenges for perspective residents is finding a location that is close to their preferred amenities, dining, and shopping.  We created a program that allows users to adjust their shopping preferences to create a heatmap that will show them the best place to live based on these preferences.

----Requirements----
Openstreetmaps
MonumentJS (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.15.1/moment.min.js)
Flask
FlaskCors
LeafletCSS (https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css)
Leaflet JavaScript Code (https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js)
D3 Library (https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js), (https://d3js.org/d3-hexbin.v0.2.min.js)

----Installation----
Extract the file to your local github repository.  Open index.html to access the website interface.  Note that a Flask workspace must be running inside this file, which can be started by entering 'app.py' in GitBash.

----Use----
Simply open the index.html file in your browser.  You can then adjust the heatmap by selecting or deselting the categories and adjusting the sliders based on your preferences.  Then you should be able to navigate around the map using your mouse.
